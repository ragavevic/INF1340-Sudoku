# INF1340 Sudoku Game

Sudoku is a popular puzzle game in which the goal is to fill a 9 by 9 grid with numbers between 1 and 9 so that each row, column, and block (3 by 3 section) contain each previously mentioned digit. This project was created for the INF1340 course using the pygame library in Python.

## Instructions
1. Only the numbers 1 through 9 can be used on the board
2. The program will not allow you to repeat any of the numbers in the same row, block, or column
3. To input a number press the box you want to use and enter a number from 1 to 9
4. If you would like to change the number either press the same number you inputted or a different number
5. If you would like to erase the inputted number press the same number you inputted again
6. If you would like to reset the board press **D** on your keyboard
7. After you are done filling the board and you would like to check your answer press **Enter** or **Return** on your keyboard
8. If you wish to see the solution without inputting any values press **Enter**
